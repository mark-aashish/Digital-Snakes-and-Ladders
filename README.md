# Digital-Snakes-and-Ladders
Using the basic Adders, comparators,4x1 MUXs, DMUXs and flip flops we have designed the Snakes and Ladders game. We used a high frequency 4 bit counter from JK flip flop for the dice. The value on dice is added to the respective team by use of and gates and an enable signal. From here we use a MUX to select whose number to process for snake or ladder. For a snake, we would drop down to a number which was decided earlier and for a ladder, we go up to the decided number. Final scores of respective team is stored in D flip flop and score displayed on 7 segment display.
